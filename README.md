### Helping for a beautiful app icon
if someone can make a beautiful icon for this app, it will be very appreciate !

### By completing `conversion.json`
This file is the core of the application, it describe what is supposed to be displayed on the `Home` page, on each element in the list and the conversion formula to use.

> The `icon` key must have a value accepted on the [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website
#### Example of a category
```json
{
    "category": "mycategory",
    "title": "My Category",
    "icon": "tint",
    "reference": "UnityName",
    "units": [
        {
            "name": "UnityName",
            "symbol": "Â°C",
            "formula": "* 1"
        },
        {
            "name": "OtherUnity",
            "symbol": "Â°F",
            "formula": "* 1.8 + 32",
            "reverseFormula": "- 32 / 1.8"
        }
    ]
}
```
> The formula must always have a space between the `operand` and the `number` and there is no notion of mathematical priority. **It's always calculated in the order of the formula**.  
Also, for each `operand` you must have a following number and the first caracter must always be an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
